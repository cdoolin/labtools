# Labtools

A collection of scripts to control various aspects of running experiments.  Written by Callum Doolin for use in [The Davis Lab](https://sites.ualberta.ca/~jdavis/) at the University of Alberta in Edmonton, Canada.

These scripts typically depend on the [Labdrivers](https://github.com/cdoolin/labdrivers) Python module. Most scripts were written for use with Python 2, however may be compatible with Python 3.
